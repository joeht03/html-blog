						<h2>About the Project:</h2>
						<p>Hi! I'm Joseph, a Mathematics and Physics undergraduate at the University of Warwick. I am very passionate about the field of Medical Physics and am very lucky to have landed an Undergraduate Research Support Scheme (URSS) project researching and experimenting with an up-and-coming medical imaging technique!</p> 
						<p>This summer, for around 2 months, I will be working alongside the current Warwick Terabotics research team on a project......... Stay tuned!</p>

				<h2>Introducing myself:</h2>
				<p>I am a 21 year old from Leicester currently studying for an Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Physics (MMathPhys) at the University of Warwick.</p>
				<p>I spent most of my childhood heavily involved in music, getting my grade 8 in Trumpet and grade 5 in Piano by age 14 as well as teaching myself to play multiple other brass and woodwind instruments such as both alto and tenor saxophone. I was in an orchestra, brass group and jazz band and performed in many concerts and charity fundraisers through my music association.</p>
				<p>I am very enthusiastic about staying active, having taken up karate in my early teens, and developed a love for the gym at 16.</p>
				<p>I come from quite an academic family â€“ 2 of my grandparents were teachers and both my parents studied law at Leeds Poly in the 80s. My sister, who also has an affinity for STEM, is currently undertaking a PhD at UoL in Engineering, working in the field of nanoplating.</p>

					<h3>Week 1: Initial Setup and Literature Review</h3>
					<p>On my first day, I attended the department meeting where I met the current PhD students I'd be working alongside. They each explained what they were currently working on and their plans for the week/going forward. After this meeting, I was kindly shown around the lab setup, had relevant content explained to me and was sent reading material to review. At this moment, my project goal is not set in stone, but I think I will work on data analysis and image formulation from scan data.</p>
					<p>I started working on some python code to visualise some data collected. Using the process explained to me by PhD student Ben, I put together some code for taking the detected THz pulse data and isolating the relevant returned information, then analysing that through use of Fourier Transforms.</p>
