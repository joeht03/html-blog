						<h2>About the Project:</h2>
						<p>Hi! I'm Joseph, a Mathematics and Physics undergraduate at the University of Warwick. I am very passionate about the field of Medical Physics and am very lucky to have landed an Undergraduate Research Support Scheme (URSS) project researching and experimenting with an up-and-coming medical imaging technique!</p> 
						<p>This summer, for 2 months, I will be working alongside the current Warwick Terabotics research team studying this medical imaging system, processing data taken using the Picobot (see image) and investigating some interesting ideas - such as the relationship between regions of skin across the body (as it may hold interesting information with diagnostic potential).</p>
						<P>There will be a lot of initial learning required and the continual development of my own code to process information, so early progress towards my end project goal may be slow. However, building a comprehensive understanding of the science and writing my own python program to analyse data will be an important skill to cultivate and carry into my 4th year project - in which I will be working in the same department furthering my research. </p>
						<p>The image displayed, the Picobot, is the medical imaging robot consisting of a THz scanning probe for imaging (a THz emitter and detector mounted inside the head) and a robot arm which has 6 axis and degrees of freedom! The emitter sends out THz pulses to a quartz window which is placed in (as close to) flush contact with the sample - this is not always possible but ways to improve consistent contact are being researched (air pockets between the sample and quartz causes large occlusions of the THz waves). The emitted waves are reflected at the first and second quartz interfaces, quartz-air inside the probe and quartz-sample at the quartz-sample contact points, and detected by a THz detector.

						<h2>Introducing myself:</h2>
						<p>I am a 21 year old from Leicester currently studying for an Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Physics (MMathPhys) at the University of Warwick.</p>
						<p>I spent most of my childhood heavily involved in music, getting my grade 8 in Trumpet and grade 5 in Piano by age 14 as well as teaching myself to play multiple other brass and woodwind instruments such as alto and tenor saxophone. I was in an orchestra, brass group and jazz band and performed in many concerts, theatre productions and charity fundraisers through my music association.</p>
						<p>I am very enthusiastic about staying active, having taken up karate in my early teens and developed a passion for the gym at 16.</p>
						<p>I come from a very academic family â€“ 2 of my grandparents were teachers, both my parents studied Law with French at Leeds Poly in the 80s. My sister is currently undertaking a PhD at UoL in Engineering working in the field of material science, particularly nanoplating.</p>
						<p>I am slowly but surely learning Mandarin to better communicate with my girlfriend's family, and have actually been to Inner Mongolia (and traveled a little to Beijing and Datong) with them for 3 weeks.

					<h3>Week 1: Initial Setup and Literature Review</h3>
					<p>On my first day, I attended the weekly department meeting where I met the current PhD students I'd be working alongside. They each explained what they were currently working on and their plans for the week going forward. After this meeting, I was kindly shown around the lab setup, had relevant content explained to me and was sent reading material to review. At this moment in time, my project goal is not actually set in stone - I have discussed with my supervisor project plans but she also has some ideas in mind for things she'd like researching. I enjoy putting my coding knowledge to good use so I think I will work on data analysis and image formulation from scan data to investigate potential relationships skin optical properties have across varying regions of the body.</p>
					<p>I started working on some python code to visualise some single-point data collected. There are two types of scans taken by the Picobot: single-point scans which return reflected waveform information at a particular point on a sample, or 2D scans which essentially takes multiple 1D scans across the whole quartz window of the scanning probe - this data can be arranged from scan coordinates across the window to produce a 2D heatmap image depicting properties of a sample.  Using the analysis process explained to me by PhD student Ben, I put together some code for taking the detected THz pulse data and isolating the relevant returned information to plot out frequency-domain properties of the scanned sample such as refractive index and FFTs.</p>

                    <h3>Week 2: Image Reconstruction, Acquisition and Analysis </h3>
                    <p>This week, I started to work on code for generating 2D images. This involved a lot of scaling up my code for 1D analysis to iterate the process for approximately 2700 total points! These ~2700 point scans across the quartz window are interpolated to fill an 100*100 grid image with dimensions approximately 22*22mm (the quartz window is a 22mm diametre circle, so some post-interpolation processing is required).</p>
					<p>I produced images depicting the FFT maximum amplitude (the FFT of the quartz-sample boundary reflection), the reflection peak-to-peak, the phase and the refractive index of the sample. From these, I was able to determine these such characteristic properties of samples such as water and skin of the volar forearm.</p>
					<p>I was able to assist a colleague with some of his research into impedence matching, allowing him to take some images of my volar forearm with a thin layer of paraffin gel applied - like how ultrasounds require the use of a gel to eliminate too-great difference in acoustic impedence between skin and air, the paraffin is intended to harmlessly fill in the air gaps in the top layer of skin.</p>

                    <h3>Week 3: Making an app!</h3>
                    <p>After a meeting with my supervisor, I decided to turn my data processing codes, both 1D and 2D, into an application! I turned my focus towards learning how to make a GUI so I could streamline my process of image generation and ultimately aim to make a self-contained .exe that can be used to produce images and plots in a quick, user-friendly way. This would prove useful for not only my research project now but my 4th year (final year) project working in the same field. </p>
					<p>This took up most of my time and progressed quite quickly. I was now able to upload, by simply dragging-and-dropping, .npz files produced by the Picobot and, in return, produce images and plots showing properties of scanned samples. After running into issues regarding the variablity of file lengths and certain waveform characteristics, I had to keep improving elements of my code which handled how the waveform arrays were indexed for calculations and make the processes more adaptable, enabling the programme to function consistently and make the correct decisions regardless of differences in scan variables such as duration. </p> 
                </section>

                <section id="week4">
                    <h3>Week 4: Further app development + side task</h3>
                    <p>This week, I continued to flesh out my app, adding in .txt file compatibility after being sent some data files to look at which happened to be in this format.</p>
					<p>I upgraded my 1D plots to now be interactive, reading out the data values at selected points, interpolating data in between existing data points and being downloadable straight away. This was a big step in improving the usefulness of the app, allowing for greater accuracy and generally speeding up the process of data aquisition for better user-friendly-ness. </p>
					<p>These changes were also implemented for my 2D images, adding the ability to change interpolation method for image generation in addtion to reading out data at a given point etc. My aim is to add in as many features as possible that I think will be useful for data processing.</p>
					<p>I presented my current progress in our weekly Monday deparement meeting and my colleague Agrima suggested the ability to click on the 2D image and for a plot of the waveform at that position to be displayed. I implemented this within the next day or so.</p>
					<p>Along with my app development, I also looked into how well picobot images are able to define boundaries between 2 sharply contrasting regions, as this is an important detail to be aware of if these images were to be used to determine skin legion boundaries for example. I was able to determine from the gradient of values across the boundary between two very differing sample materials, metal foil and air, where one material truely ended and one began. This boundary was on average blurred over a width of approximatey 3.78mm (averaging over 4 different image types) with the best image type, Max FFT Amplitude, giving 3.00mm.

					<h3>Week 5: Taking some scans + side tasks</h3>
					<div class="project-section">
						<div class="text-content">
							<p>While continuing to work on my app, my supervisor asked me to look into some maths behind the sampling frequency of waveform pulses emitted. I started to look into how much you could reduce the sampling frequency, currently around 4 pulses per second, and still obtain the same characteristic data seen in the early moments of a scan where changes happen in the skin due to undergoing compression now in contact with the probe quartz window.</p>
							<p>I compared the data produced at different sampling frequencies, determined the errors introduced by less frequent pulses and trialed interpolation methods to try and preserve/recover as much data as possible.</p>
							<p>My colleague Agrima asked me to assist her on some research into a similarly inclined project - taking images at lower resolutions to then see if they can be artifically upscaled. Lower resolution scans take far less time to complete as less total points are measured to then be interpolated into an image grid. Less points going into a 100*100 grid, as I previously discussed, mean that more inaccuracies will be introduced by the interpolation process to fill out the grid points. We took scans of a credit card chip and a hand scar at 2 different resolutions to then contrast and compare the image produced to see if key information was preserved or could be recovered from the lower resolution image.</p>
							<p>My own investigation into this struggled to get the same information out of both resolution images eg. determining the length of the hand scar was possible from the higher resolution image but not from the lower resolution image. However, the images of the credit card chip proved more promising, likely due to the large contrasts in material from metal to plastic as opposed to skin and new scar tissue.</p>
							<p>I started to analyse some old scan data taken at varying points across the body - forehead, cheek, finger and volar forearm. My goal is to build up my own small database of scans to complement these pre-existing scans and then try to establish some relationships in the data.

                    <h3>Week 6: Collecting sample scans - slow progress week</h3>
                    <p>I started to collect some scans of myself and Ben in 2 different spots, the temple and the cheek. We took the scans at 2 resolutions so that the data could also be useful for that project too.</p>
					<p>This week, I had to move my belongings out of my uni student house as we had reached the end of our tenancy contract. This kept me quite busy, cleaning and packing and driving, and meant I didn't complete too much work in the second half of the week. Mostly just some minor bug fixes for my app and some work towards the sample frequency investigation. </p>

                    <h3>Week 7: I caught COVID </h3>
                    <p>This week... I caught COVID while visiting at my girlfriend! I therefore couldn't go into work - members of the department were set to go to a conference in Helsinki shortly so I had to minimise the risk of getting them sick too. </p>
					<p>This was very unfortunate as, alongside falling quite ill, it meant I couldn't collect any more scan data to put towards my analysis project.</p>
					<p>I tried to do what work I could. This included writing up some of my progress, adding an 'average selected region' function to my app to take data from selected areas of images, and updating my blog!</p>
					<p>I have until mid October to submit my final project documentation, which I am planning to submit in the form of a poster - I have come to realise that a lot of my time has gone towards side projects (still valid and interesting research experience) and my app, and I haven't been able to allocate enough time for collecting my own data for analysis. I planned to start taking my scans from week 5-6, but personal issues and time constraints got in the way. My usage of the Picobot to collect data is restricted as I am new, only recently trained on the system and need a supervisor to oversee my work. In addition to this, the robot does disappear off to be tinkered on in the Engineering department from time to time so is sometimes unavailable.</p>
					<p>Having come down rather sick with COVID at a very unfortunate time, I know that this will have a large impact what I had intended to be my main point of research to be as it depends heavily on having a lot of sample data collected - and I can't do so! I will have to try and get some scans done in my final week which I can then work through after my time in the department comes to an end.

                    <h3>Week 8: Staying positive - in all regards </h3>
                    <p>I remained out of office as I was still testing positive for COVID. </p>
					<p>Later in the week, I finally tested negative but still am suffering from fatigue and dizzy spells unfortunately.</p>
					<p>I will be continuing my project for a week or two after recovering from COVID due to this time lost.</p>

                    <h3>Week 9: Department goes international!</h3>
                    <p>This week, the majority of the department I've been working alongside went to a conference in Helsinki to present research etc. This meant I had no reason to go into the office in person, as to collect data I need supervision, so I remained at home.</p>
					<p>Having taken 2-3 weeks off now due to either sickness and my colleagues also being away, I now need to focus on drawning conclusions from my work and compiling it for my URSS poster. I still need to collect some additional data to analyse, but I am faced with the problem of not having many people around to scan. I think I will have to continue this research into year 4 when students will be back on campus who I then can ask to participate.</p>

                    <h3>Week 10: Back in office</h3>

                    <p>As my project draws to a close, I am starting to produce my project summary poster displaying everything I've worked on this summer. I have multiple projects to include - the experience I have gained in each area has been very positive and academically stimulating. I will be able to design a very informative, educational poster displaying what I learned. This experience will be very beneficial for me going forward into my 4th year project and beyond into (hopefully!) a career in Medical Physics.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>This URSS project in the Terahertz Group department at the University of Warwick has been an amazing experience and I am coming away from it with 2+ months worth of invaluable experience. I've worked alongside some kind, intelligent and welcoming people who taught me the foundational science of the Picobot system and assisted me in the use of the Picobot itself to image samples.</p>
					<p>I developed an app which I will take with me into my 4th year project in this department, and I plan to continually improve it along the way to best suit my needs. I will also be able to give it to my lab partner and anyone will find use for it.</p>
					<p>My programming range has improved throughout this project - developing code in Python to process Picobot data and later implementing that into an app, and writing this very blog page in HTML and launching it through Github. Expanding my programming knowledge will always be important, and this project pushed me to learn many new things in multiple coding languages.</p>
					<p>My research into sample frequency reduction (reduce system load without drastic quality reduction etc.) and skin physiology variations across the body observed via THz waves (possible diagnostic potential) will be beneficial to the future applications of Terahertz technology to skin scanning. I am in the lucky position to have further access to this technology to trial it personally in the coming academic year.

				<h2>My app:</h2>
				<div class="project-section">
					<div class="text-content">
						<p>I have been working on making an app for processing the data collected by the Picobot. This data can take multiple forms, so my app needs to be able to accommodate this and be multifunctional.</p>
						<p>The Picobot takes either 1D point scans, or 2D image scans. These are either .npz files or .txt files (only for 1D scans), so I included an option to select a file type. Selection of a file type will then change which files are prompted to be imported, and which processing types are available (1D Point Analysis or 2D Image View).</p>
						<p>I have included the ability to import a time and a reference file - this is because some of the sample files I have worked with did not include their own time arrays or reference waveform data, so I had to add them in externally. For sample files which contain all the required data, the app will run on just the sample file alone. But if the required time or reference arrays are not included, you will be prompted to import the additional files.</p>
						<p>The 1D Point Analysis generates plots depicting properties such as the refractive index of a sample. The 2D image generation produces heatmap-style images showing properties such as the refractive index, max FFT amplitude, and the peak-to-peak of the sample reflected waveform.
						<br>
						<p>I have added some analysis tools to the 2D Image View:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>A slideable circular cropping filter to remove the incorrect interpolated data outside of the actual scanned window data.</li>
						  <li>An averaging tool to select an image region and extrapolate the average of data values over an area.</li>
						  <li>Interactive plots - zoom in and out, download the image, hover to show the coordinate and its value.</li>
						  <li>Click on a point to display a plot of the waveform measured at that location.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<p>My 4th year project is also in this field of study, so this app will hopefully prove itself very useful for my future work.</p>
